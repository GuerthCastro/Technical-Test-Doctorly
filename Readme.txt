Some Architectural desissionns 

- sqlite as DB: As a test of for lite applications we can use this options, haev pros and cons I decide use it cause I want to create a functional basic operations (Insert, Delete Get and update)

- The API was made it in a multi separated layers approach tryin to follow a customized provider pattern and using the .net native dependecy injection aproach.

- Naming Convention: I use to use self descriptive names for objects, clases, properties etc, using pascal case for classes, methods and properties, and camel case for method parameters and inner method variables.
